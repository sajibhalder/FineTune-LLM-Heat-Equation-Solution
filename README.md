# FineTune-LLM-Heat-Equation-Solution
## Challenge Description
Develop a complete pipeline to fine-tune the IBM Granite 3.1 LLM for interpreting solutions to the heat equation. The challenge broadly involves the following tasks:

Generating training data using numerical methods or by scraping relevant data.
Creating a fine-tuning pipeline for the LLM.
Evaluating the model's ability to provide meaningful physical interpretations of the PDE solutions.

## Input Provided
Sample code for generating and visualizing data in VTK files on a unit square mesh.
Sample code for loading the language model, making inferences, and creating submissions for the competition.

## What we Need to Do
#### Data Generation
Develop numerical solutions for the heat equation on a unit square mesh.
Generate training and validation datasets by incorporating different variants of the heat equation (details provided in the dataset section)
#### LLM Pipeline
Develop a data preprocessing pipeline: Prepare and transform the data for use in fine-tuning the language model.
Implement a fine-tuning methodology: Fine-tune the model using the prepared datasets to optimize its performance.
Document your approach and results in the code: Clearly explain your methodology, decisions, and outcomes within the codebase.
